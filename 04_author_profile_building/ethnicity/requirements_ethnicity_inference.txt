# Ethnicity Inference Pipeline Requirements
# Python >= 3.7 required

# Database
duckdb>=0.9.0

# Ethnicity Inference Tools

# ethnicseer - 12 ethnic categories (84% accuracy)
# Predicts: Chinese, English, French, German, Indian, Italian, Japanese,
#           Korean, Middle-Eastern, Russian, Spanish, Vietnamese
ethnicseer>=0.1.2

# pyethnicity - US-centric race prediction with ML models
# Predicts: Asian, Black, Hispanic, White
# Note: Requires onnxruntime for ML model inference
pyethnicity>=0.0.27
onnxruntime>=1.15.0
polars>=0.19.0  # Required by pyethnicity for DataFrame operations

# ethnidata - Nationality/country prediction with regional context
# Predicts: 238 countries, 6 regions, 72 languages
ethnidata>=3.0.3

# name2nat - Global nationality prediction (254 nationalities)
# Predicts: 254 nationalities from Wikipedia data
# Note: May have dependency conflicts in some environments
# If installation fails, you can skip this tool
name2nat>=0.5.1

# raceBERT - State-of-the-art transformer-based prediction (86% f1-score)
# Predicts: Race/ethnicity using RoBERTa transformer models
# IMPORTANT: Requires PyTorch
# Note: PyTorch is NOT available for Intel Macs
# Works on Apple Silicon Macs, Linux, and Windows
# Installation instructions: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
racebert>=1.1.0
# torch>=2.0.0  # Uncomment after installing PyTorch for your system
# transformers>=4.0.0  # Required by raceBERT

# Machine Learning Dependencies
scikit-learn>=1.0.0
numpy>=1.21.0

# Optional: Enhanced Performance
# numba>=0.56.0  # Uncomment for faster numerical computations

# Note on TensorFlow/ethnicolr:
# ethnicolr (alternative tool) requires TensorFlow, which may have
# compatibility issues with some Python versions. If you want to use
# ethnicolr, add:
# tensorflow>=2.0.0
# ethnicolr>=0.19.0

# Installation Tips:
# 1. Install core tools first: pip install ethnicseer pyethnicity ethnidata
# 2. Try name2nat: pip install name2nat (may fail due to dependencies)
# 3. For raceBERT on new Mac Studio:
#    - Visit https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
#    - Install PyTorch for your system
#    - Then: pip install racebert transformers
